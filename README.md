## 🎉 KUBERNETES EDGE COMPUTING FRAMEWORK - MSc PROJECT SUMMARY

A comprehensive Kubernetes-based Edge Computing Framework has been developed for my MSc Computer Science final year project, demonstrating advanced edge computing management capabilities.

## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

Backend (FastAPI + MongoDB): robust REST API with extensive endpoints, real-time WebSocket connections, MongoDB integration, and error handling.

Frontend (React + Shadcn/UI): modern responsive web interface, real-time dashboard, interactive components.

Database (MongoDB): edge node registry, workload orchestration, performance metrics, security event logging.

## 🎯 MSc PROJECT OBJECTIVES

All primary objectives including Kubernetes distribution, central management, edge-cloud orchestration, performance optimization, and security have been implemented.

## 🌟 KEY FEATURES

Dashboard Overview, Edge Nodes Management, Workload Orchestration, Performance Analytics, Security Center, and Smart City Use Case demonstration have all been built and tested.

## 📊 CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS

Live metrics and system performance are within optimal or efficient ranges.

## 🧪 TESTING

Backend, frontend, and integration testing show all critical components operational.

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT

The platform is live and accessible at: https://kube-edge-compute.preview.emergentagent.com

I have thoroughly tested the application to the best of my capabilities. Please review and test the platform on your side, and let me know if you observe any issues or if further investigation is needed.
